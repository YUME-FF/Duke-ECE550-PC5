## Testing

### Basic Testing

- State: ALL PASSED! ðŸŽ‰

- [x] Test basic functionality of all arithmetic/logic/shifting/loading/saving instructions.

### Half Test Cases Testing

- State: ALL PASSED! ðŸŽ‰

- [x] Using more cases to test for all arithmetic/logic/shifting/loading/saving instructions.

### Corner Cases Testing

- State: ALL PASSED! ðŸŽ‰

- [x] Test behaviors when try to assign nonzero value to `$r0`
- [x] Verify handling when overflow happens



## Issue Tracker

### ISSUE 1

- State: âœ… SOLVED!
- Position: `skeleton_tb.v`
- Description: The processor doesn't work, but all four clocks work as expected.
- Fix: RESET the processor when start it.



### ISSUE 2

- State: âœ… SOLVED!
- Position: `clock.v` and `processor.v`
- Description: Only base clock and the one for `imem` work, while the other three clocks stays at `x`.
- Fix: Build a separate clock divider module to quarter the clock frequency.



### ISSUE 3

- State: âœ… SOLVED!
- Position: `processor.v`
- Description: The signal value given to `rstatus` is wrong when overflow happens.
- Fix:
    - Correct the assignment of signal values for the three different scenarios in `rstatus`;
    - Modify the logics of `if_ovf` signal by replacing the choice of gate from `AND` to `OR`.



## Cautions

- Always run `git pull` before you start developing in local repo. This will sync local repo and remote repo.
